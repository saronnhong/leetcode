// # Given a list of numbers, find all the minimum peaks in the list using the following operation.
// # Each time you find a peak, delete it and store it to be returned at the end.
// # Examples:
// # [1,4,5,3,8,6] , output = [5,4,8,6,3,1]
// # [1,4,5,3,8,6], Min peak = 5, resultant = [1,4,3,8,6]
// # [1,4,3,8,6], Min peak = 4, resultant = [1,3,8,6]
// # [1,3,8,6], Min peak = 8, resultant = [1,3,6]
// # [1,3,6], Min peak = 6, resultant = [1,3]
// # [1,3], Min peak = 3, resultant = [1]
// # [1], min peak = 1
// # Output = [5,4,8,6,3,1]
